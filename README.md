You can test this at  => https://notaddtry-mail.herokuapp.com/


In this case i realized ERN(express,react,node) app(with const database)

You can add,edit and remove folders

Also you can try search for messages(realized with query params)

In last,you can add messages to favorite and mark them.

If you try reload app,changes wont be reloaded,because all of them are sended to server.

If you want to test-drive this project in your localhost,you need to clone this rep =>
then run into terminal npm run local => 
then run into terminal npm run dev

All your request from frontend will proxy to http://localhost:5000 ,where backend relocated.
