You can test this at  => https://notaddtry-mail.herokuapp.com/

In this case i realized ERN(express,react,node) app(with const database)
You can add,edit and remove folders
Also you can try search for messages(realized with query params)
In last,you can add messages to favorite and mark them.

If you try reload app,changes wont be reloaded,because all of them are sended to server.
